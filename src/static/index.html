The site was built with React and Node.js, using the Contentful CMS.","This project presented various unique challenges, as the site needed to accomodate streaming live events as well as being constantly updated with new information about live races. The modern design of the site allowed me to make use of newer technologies such as CSS Grid, however it was important to convey the unusual design without compromising on performance and accessibility."],"image":"/img/sailgp-full.webp","link":"https://sailgp.com","extraIcon":"/img/ar-logo.webp","extraIconAlt":"AmazeRealise"},{"id":"coop","title":"Co-op Food","details":["During my time at AmazeRealise, I worked as one of two developers on the Co-operative Food website.

This project provided me with a great experience of designing an end-to-end solution, and acting as a full stack developer using technologies such as Azure and Algolia for the site’s search.","Along with the main Co-op Food site, I also built various seasonal themed mini-sites for The Co-op, which all necessitated a fast turnaround."],"image":"/img/coop-full.webp","extraIcon":"/img/ar-logo.webp","extraIconAlt":"AmazeRealise"},{"id":"lexus","title":"Lexus","details":["I’ve also been part of AmazeRealise’s largest development team in working on the Lexus website.
